                The objective of this website is to provide a brief
                 introduction to my academic life and job experience.
                 Additionally, I intend to explain some of the projects
                 I have undertaken in the past.
            </p>

            <p>In 2017, I commenced my studies in <i>Energy Engineering</i> at <a class="header" href="https://www.uma.es"> 
                University of Malaga </a>. Over time, I realized my desire to pursue
            international experiences.
                </p>
                    
            <p>In 2021, I relocated to Seville to further my studies in <a class="header" 
                href="https://www.us.es/"> University of Seville</a>. While there,
                I pursued a specialization within my degree titled 
                <i>Power Production Systems</i>.
                The specialization focused on 
                <b>conventional energy generation</b> systems,
                 including 
                <b>Combined Cycle Power Plants, Nuclear Power Plants</b>, etc.</p>

            <p>In 2022, I continued my studies in Río de Janeiro, Brazil. From August
               onward, I spent 5 months in Niteroi, attending 
               <a class="header" href="https://www.uff.br/">Fluminense Federal University</a></a>.</p>

            <p>By January 2023, I had returned from Brazil and began
                a trainee job. The role centered around <b>Renewable
                Energies</b> projects, with a major focus on designing
                <b>photovoltaic systems</b> for self-consumption. 
                
                <!--This involved
                crafting the suitable system based on client demands and
                requirements, budgeting the project, and overseeing the
                installation team.--> 
                
                The internship concluded at the end of June.</p>

            <p>At that time, all that remained for me to graduate was completing
                my thesis. Come September, I successfully presented my thesis to
                the University. The project received a grade of <b>9.5</b> out
                of 10 and went on to become a <b>finalist</b> for an 
                <b>energy efficiency award</b>.</p>
